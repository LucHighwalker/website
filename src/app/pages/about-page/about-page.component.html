          'A long long time ago, in a classroom not so far away. I wrote my first line of code and have been teaching myself to code ever since. With the past 2 years primarily focused on web technologies. In the summer of 2017, I landed an internship at Hospitality Pulse under the guidance of Denis Bajet. While I learned a ton over the course of the internship, I also came to realize that I was missing some core fundamentals due to being self taught. So after the internship, I sought out going back to school. But with a lack of motivation to torture myself in the traditional schooling system, a Reddit ad pointed me towards Make School. An extensive 2 year coding bootcamp which I am currently attending. Armed with solidifed fundamentals and 6 years of progressive coding experience, I am ready to join a team and do my part to create kick-ass tech.'
